# Data Science Capstone
### Land Use Change Dynamics

Fall Quarter (2021)

--- 
**Week 1** - Introduction to land-use change. What is land use? How do we measure it using remote sensing?

Please read the following sites/articles.

* [What are remotely-sensed vegetation indices?](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/eros/phenology/science/ndvi-foundation-remote-sensing-phenology?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)

* [A fairly dry catalog of vegetation indices](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02757259509532298?needAccess=true)

**Week 2** - Introduction to Google Earth Engine and Colab Interface

Google Earth Engine contains a huge amount of processed satellite data. This quarter, we will use Google Colab for ease of interface with these data sources. For this week, you need to get yourself set up 

1. Get yourself a Google Earth Engine account with your ucsd.edu email address.
2. Work through [this tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/earthengine-api/blob/master/python/examples/ipynb/ee-api-colab-setup.ipynb) to link your earth engine account to your Colab/Drive. Step through the tutorial to understand some of the basic Earth Engine functionality.
3. Create your own Colab file for this quarter. Set it up for Earth Engine API access, and load in data from Sentinel 2. 

For the future, you can also access Earth Engine data and commands via your own python installation ([see here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install)).
